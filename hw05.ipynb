    "A. When make a hypothesis test, the comparison object needs enough data to make a meaningful comparison. For example, compare \"Hillary vs. U.S. presidential election campaigns such as Trump cannot be used as the basis for hypothesis testing, because neither of them became president at the time of the campaign, and they could not get relevant data on their presidential performance.When there is not enough data, the future performance can also be speculated through the existing information. For example, assuming that Biden's presidential performance is to be predicted in some cases, the future situation can be speculated on the existing Biden's performance. The \"null hypothesis\" mentioned in the video should be more accurately expressed as \"we cannot reject the original hypothesis\", because the original hypothesis needs evidence to refute, not to prove that it is correct.\n",
    "In addition, when it comes to \"comparing the original hypothesis with the alternative hypothesis\", it is more mathematically accurate to use the version of \"less than or equal to\", not just \"less than\"."

It needs to be clear, specific, and tied to something that can be empirically assessed.A good null hypothesis is clear, testable, and represents a statement of \"no effect\" or \"no difference.\" And also it should be falsifiable.The null hypothesis suggests no effect or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that there is an effect or difference. The goal of hypothesis testing is to use data to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative."

    "Request for Help with Code Adjustment: You requested guidance on modifying the code for a \"one-sided\" (or \"one-tailed\") hypothesis test instead of the \"two-sided\" version it originally provided. We discussed that the primary change would be in how the p-value is calculated—shifting from considering deviations in both directions (two-tailed) to focusing on one direction (one-tailed). This leads to a smaller p-value in a one-tailed test if the effect is in the hypothesized direction, as we are only considering one tail of the distribution.\n",
    "Clarifying Hypothesis Test Interpretation: We also touched on how the interpretation of a one-sided test changes compared to a two-sided one, as a one-sided test only looks for evidence in one direction. Therefore, this test is more specific and may result in a smaller p-value when the direction aligns with the hypothesis.\n",
